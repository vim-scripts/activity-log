Activity log is a plugin which simply logs what you're doing and when. For the latest version, to report a problem, or contact the author please visit https://github.com/AD7six/vim-activity-log

What does it do:

if you open and save a file, it'll create a log entries such as the following:

    2011-02-09 08:44:16;open;/home/andy/someproject/somefile
    2011-02-09 08:44:44;write;/home/andy/someproject/somefile
    ...

If you're in a git repository at the time, it'll also log the current branch at the time of writing, for example:


    2011-02-09 08:44:16;open;/home/andy/someproject/somefile
    2011-02-09 08:44:44;write;/home/andy/someproject/somefile;special-stuff
    ...

Why:

The main purpose of this plugin is to make time reporting easy for the forgetful programmer, without additional tools it provides a static log for you, but the format is such that you can easily import or analyze using whatever tool you feel comfortable with.
